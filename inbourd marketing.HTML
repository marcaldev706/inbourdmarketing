 Gamers may experience feelings of anxiety after engaging in gaming for several reasons. The immersive nature of video games can create a heightened sense of engagement, leading to emotional investment in characters and narratives. 

 Additionally, competitive gaming environments often involve high-stakes situations where performance is scrutinised, triggering stress and anxiety associated with potential failure or negative judgement from peers. 
                        
 The need for constant connectivity and the fear of missing out can also contribute to anxiety, especially in multiplayer settings where social dynamics play a significant role. Furthermore, prolonged gaming sessions may disrupt healthy routines, affecting sleep patterns and overall mental well-being, which can exacerbate feelings of anxiety post-gaming.
                        
                        
                        
                        
The gaming industry has experienced remarkable and significant growth over recent years, with global revenue projected to exceed AUD 200 billion by the year 2025. This impressive surge in popularity highlights numerous positive aspects of gaming that many players enjoy, including enhanced cognitive skills, improved hand-eye coordination, and valuable opportunities for social interaction with others. 
                        
Exposure to cooperative games can effectively foster essential teamwork and communication skills among players, while strategically challenging titles can serve to significantly enhance critical thinking and problem-solving abilities in various contexts. 
                        
 However, it is crucial to maintain a balanced and mindful approach to gaming, as excessive playtime can lead to negative outcomes such as social isolation and decreased levels of physical activity. Thus, recognising both the numerous benefits and potential drawbacks of gaming allows for a much healthier and more enjoyable engagement with this increasingly popular form of entertainment.
